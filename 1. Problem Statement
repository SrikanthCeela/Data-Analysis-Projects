The company's sales director, Bhavin Patel, is facing challenges in tracking sales and gaining insights into the business due to the dynamically growing market. 
There are multiple Excel files, making it difficult to analyze the data and identify areas where sales are declining. 
The objective of this data analysis project is to provide simple, understandable, and digestible insights to help the company focus on regions where 
sales numbers are declining and develop strategies such as promotion offers or better customer engagement to address these issues.
